# Final Year Project

This project focuses on creating an Augmented Reality (AR) rehabilitation system for post-shoulder surgery patients. The platform provides interactive, 3D-guided exercises to enhance recovery. It ensures correct posture and movement through real-time feedback, increasing patient engagement and adherence to therapy. Using AR overlays in the patient's real environment, the solution reduces dependency on hospital visits and supports remote rehabilitation.

### Key Features:
3D exercise models with real-time guidance.
Interactive AR environment for motivation.
Accessible on AR-capable devices.
This approach modernizes traditional physiotherapy with engaging, immersive technology.
